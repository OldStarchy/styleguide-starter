# SASS + KSS + Browser Sync Starter

To get started, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then either `npx gulp kss:watch` or use the equivalent VSCode task.

You'll mostly be wanting to edit in the scss folder, however changes in `builder/index.hbs` and `builder/kss-assets/` will trigger a reload too.
